# Library project challange

This is a self driven project idea to improve my coding skills and ability to design and implement advanced c/c++ concepts and programming in general.

## Goals
- Trying to implement my own save mechanism and my own confing parser (Let's say a custom json for my self, not really practical in real world, it's just for learning how parser works)
- Creating the menu section using command pattern design pattern
- Implementing SOLID principles and clean code
- Working with libraries like functional and sstream and lambda functions in c++
- Implementing multiple inheritance

Overall this was just a fun OOP coding practice 

Note that the project is not completed yet and any contribution is welcomed :)
